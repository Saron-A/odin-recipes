          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Chicken casserole is a hearty and versatile dish featuring tender
            pieces of chicken combined with vegetables like carrots, celery, and
            peas, all enveloped in a creamy, savory sauce. The sauce, often made
            from cream of chicken soup or a homemade béchamel, is seasoned with
            herbs such as thyme or rosemary. The dish is typically layered with
            a starchy element like pasta, rice, or potatoes, making it a
            well-rounded meal that's baked to perfection. Topped with a crunchy
            layer of breadcrumbs, cheese, or crushed crackers, chicken casserole
            offers a delightful texture contrast. It's a warm and comforting
            dish, perfect for family dinners, potlucks, or meal prep. The
            recipe's flexibility allows for the use of various ingredients,
            making it easy to tailor the flavors to your taste.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="ingredients chicken">
        <li><b>A.</b> One can of condensed cream of chicken soup</li>

        <li><b>B.</b> One fourth cup milk</li>
        <li><b>C.</b> Six skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

        <li><b>D.</b> Six slices of Swiss cheese</li>
        <li><b>E.</b> Two cups of herb-seasoned stuffing mix</li>
        <li><b>F.</b> One fourth butter, melted</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <div class="steps">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an
            8x12-inch baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk condensed soup and milk together in a small bowl until well
            combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover and bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the
            center and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165
            degrees F (74 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Layer each breast with
            a slice Swiss cheese, then spoon soup mixture over top. Sprinkle
            with stuffing mix and drizzle with butter.
          </li>
        </ol>
