    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken casserole is a hearty and versatile dish featuring tender pieces
      of chicken combined with vegetables like carrots, celery, and peas, all
      enveloped in a creamy, savory sauce. The sauce, often made from cream of
      chicken soup or a homemade b√©chamel, is seasoned with herbs such as thyme
      or rosemary. The dish is typically layered with a starchy element like
      pasta, rice, or potatoes, making it a well-rounded meal that's baked to
      perfection. Topped with a crunchy layer of breadcrumbs, cheese, or crushed
      crackers, chicken casserole offers a delightful texture contrast. It's a
      warm and comforting dish, perfect for family dinners, potlucks, or meal
      prep. The recipe's flexibility allows for the use of various ingredients,
      making it easy to tailor the flavors to your taste.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>One can of condensed cream of chicken soup</li>

      <li>One fourth cup milk</li>
      <li>Six skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>

      <li>Six slices of Swiss cheese</li>
      <li>Two cups of herb-seasoned stuffing mix</li>
      <li>One fourth butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x12-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk condensed soup and milk together in a small bowl until well
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange chicken in the prepared baking dish. Layer each breast with a
        slice Swiss cheese, then spoon soup mixture over top. Sprinkle with
        stuffing mix and drizzle with butter.
